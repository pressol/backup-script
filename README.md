# backup-script
[![Build](https://github.com/pressol/backup-script/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pressol/backup-script/actions/workflows/build.yml)

These scripts will allow for me to run a backup and encrypt it locally then store it in MEGA
using or and other application that i need to use.

## Passwords
Passwords for the encrypted tar.bz2 files are stored locally on the machine that makes the backup.
So delete the file and lose access to the backups.
Sort of smart but not if you lose access to the machine due to a corrupted install but smart ish if you don't want to recover the data in the backups
